Now in user-service folder, i want to use fastAPI python. Set up a boiler template for me please

Key responses:
Set up [user-service](/Users/weihungloh/FoC-Template/user-service) with FastAPI, CORS, PostgreSQL connection helper, and Dockerfile.
- Connection string saved in ignored .env.
- Database verified using SELECT 1.
- Frontend proxy and cross-origin connection verified.
- No health endpoint, schema, tables, or code comments added.
- Two tests pass. Docker build wasn’t tested because its daemon is stopped.

14-09-2026 20:48 | Usage scenario: Rename reusable endpoints in frontend
Prompt: The endpointconfig and useCampusErrandsAPI If possible can make it e.g. api.user.authentication. ... Create an empty object for supplier, order, credit too so it calls api.<service>. .

Key responses:
Updated the API structure:

```ts
api.user.authentication.signIn(...)
api.user.authentication.signUp(...)
api.user.authentication.verify(...)
api.user.authentication.signOut(...)

api.supplier
api.order
api.credit
```

The empty service objects are present in both [endpointConfig.ts](/Users/weihungloh/FoC-Template/ui/src/api/endpointConfig.ts) and [useCampusErrandsAPI.ts](/Users/weihungloh/FoC-Template/ui/src/api/useCampusErrandsAPI.ts).

All callers now use `api.user.authentication`, including `ProtectedRoutes`.

16-09-2026 21:30 | Usage scenario: Make user service environment consistent with supplier service

Prompt:
look at the commit by loyaltypollution. For supplier service they used UV and python 3.14? user-service must match the same version please

Key responses:
Aligned user-service with supplier-service:
- Migrated dependencies from requirements.txt to [pyproject.toml](/Users/weihungloh/FoC-Template/user-service/pyproject.toml) and generated [uv.lock](/Users/weihungloh/FoC-Template/user-service/uv.lock).
- Set Python requirement to >=3.14.
- Updated [Dockerfile](/Users/weihungloh/FoC-Template/user-service/Dockerfile) to python:3.14-slim and uv 0.12.13.
- Added matching devcontainer configuration.
- Updated [README.md](/Users/weihungloh/FoC-Template/user-service/README.md) with uv commands.
- Removed requirements.txt.
Verification:
- uv lock --check passed with 28 resolved packages.
- Dependencies installed successfully under Python 3.14.
- Uvicorn started and /openapi.json returned HTTP 200.
- Configuration and diff checks passed.
- Docker image build was not run because the local Docker daemon is stopped.
All changes remain uncommitted.

Key responses:

- Assisted with updating service functions to accept asynchronous SQLAlchemy sessions.
- Explained how database sessions should be passed from FastAPI endpoints through service and repository functions.
- Helped troubleshoot missing session arguments in authentication dependencies.
- Explained the difference between asynchronous functions and synchronous dependencies.
- Assisted with correcting SQLAlchemy query result handling and Pydantic response validation.

Key changes:

- Updated database functions to use asynchronous SQLAlchemy sessions and queries.
- Passed database sessions through FastAPI dependencies to the relevant service and repository functions.
- Corrected missing session arguments and query-result handling in authentication-related code.

19-09-2026 15:34 | Usage scenario: Add UI for profile page based on Figma Make UI Prototype

Prompt:
Refer to this ui prototype. So currently in ui folder our home route, we should have a button thats in this zip file that shows the user profile. Clicking on it expands a sidebar that shows Profile button, role toggle button and sign out button. Profile button suppose to navigate user to a route called /profile then it shows the current username and email like in the prototype zip file. Users can change either username/email. BUtton should be disabled untill there are changes. Clicking on it will change the username/email. Use the existing patch /users/current please. IF user tries to change to a username or email that's already taken then show error toast. I think backend validation for this route is done too 

Role toggle button is for user to toggle between Requester and Courier Role. By default role is requester. This role is saved in localStorage btw

Key respones:
I found the prototype behavior: the circular account button opens a right-side drawer containing the user summary, requester/courier selector, Profile link, and Sign out button. The `/profile` page loads the current username/email, submits only changed fields to the existing GET/PATCH `/authentication/users/current`, disables Save until something changes, and sends duplicate-value `409` errors to the existing error toast. The requester/courier preference stays frontend-only in `localStorage`, defaulting to `requester`.

One scope question before I finalize the design: should the account button/sidebar appear only on `/home`, or should it be shared across `/home`, `/profile`, and `/suppliers` like the prototype’s common navbar?

Prompt:
It should be shared like navbar current there's a sign out button. Replace that with the circle avatar thingy in the prototype if possible then clicking on it shows sidebar

Key response:
I’ll replace the existing navbar Sign out button with a shared circular account button across `/home`, `/suppliers`, and `/profile`.

Three implementation choices:

1. Recommended: extract a small shared `AppHeader` with the account drawer. Each page keeps its existing layout, so the change stays narrow.
2. Duplicate the drawer in every page. Fewer structural edits initially, but behavior and styling will drift.
3. Build a full protected app-shell/layout with shared profile state. Clean long-term, but too large for the current scope.

Proposed design:

- Circular avatar button replaces Sign out and uses a simple user icon initially.
- Clicking it opens an accessible right-side drawer based on the prototype.
- The drawer fetches the current profile and shows username/email.
- Drawer actions:
  - **Profile** navigates to `/profile`.
  - Requester/Courier role control persists under one versioned `localStorage` key and defaults to `requester`.
  - **Sign out** calls the existing endpoint and returns to `/`.
- `/profile`:
  - Loads username/email through `GET /authentication/users/current`.
  - Shows editable username and email fields.
  - Save remains disabled until at least one normalized value changes.
  - PATCH sends only the changed fields to `/authentication/users/current`.
  - Successful updates refresh displayed values and show a success toast.
  - Duplicate username/email `409` messages use the existing error toast.
  - Other API failures also use the existing error toast.
- No backend changes and no test files.
- I’ll verify with lint, build, and rendered desktop/mobile interaction checks.

Does this design look right for implementation?

Prompt:
css styling can just try to imitate the prorotytipe zip file and make it in line with current heme. Recommended please

Implemented the shared prototype-inspired account experience.

- Replaced navbar Sign out buttons with a circular avatar across Home, Suppliers, and Profile.
- Avatar opens an accessible right-side account drawer.
- Drawer includes profile details, Profile navigation, Requester/Courier toggle, and Sign out.
- Requester/Courier is a global `useContext` value through [UserProvider.tsx](/Users/weihungloh/FoC-Template/ui/src/components/user/UserProvider.tsx), persisted in versioned `localStorage`, defaulting to Requester.
- Added `/profile` with editable username/email in [Profile.tsx](/Users/weihungloh/FoC-Template/ui/src/pages/profile/Profile.tsx).
- Save stays disabled until a valid normalized change exists.
- PATCH sends only changed fields.
- Successful changes update global profile state and show a success toast.
- Duplicate username/email and other API errors use the existing error toast.
- Current profile and authentication requests start concurrently in [ProtectedRoutes.tsx](/Users/weihungloh/FoC-Template/ui/src/components/protectedRoutes/ProtectedRoutes.tsx).

The styling in [AppHeader.module.css](/Users/weihungloh/FoC-Template/ui/src/components/appHeader/AppHeader.module.css) and [Profile.module.css](/Users/weihungloh/FoC-Template/ui/src/pages/profile/Profile.module.css) follows the prototype’s side drawer, typography, spacing, and green palette while matching the current theme.

Verification:

- `npm run lint` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Rendered profile, drawer, disabled/enabled Save states, and role persistence were visually checked.
- Live authenticated PATCH was not exercised because the isolated preview had no session cookie.
- No tests or test files were added.
- Changes remain uncommitted.

19-09-2026 16:19 | Usage scenario: Use ChatGPT to do up docker compose for user service

Prompt: Ok very good. now Are you able to do up a docker compose? Compose yaml similar to supplier service however in this case we are not using the psql as it is in supplier service. We want to connect it to neondb. It is in our .env  already. It should do something similar as supplier service i.e. checking for health checks those please. Everything should be similar except the psql we are connecting to the database url we alr have in neondb

Key response:
Implemented:

- Added [`user-service/compose.yaml`](/Users/weihungloh/FoC-Template/user-service/compose.yaml).
- Loads the existing `user-service/.env`, including the Neon `DATABASE_URL`.
- Exposes user-service on port `5005`.
- Adds a `/health` container health check.
- Added user-service to the root [`compose.yaml`](/Users/weihungloh/FoC-Template/compose.yaml).
- No local PostgreSQL container or volume was added for user-service.
- Supplier service’s PostgreSQL container remains unchanged.

Both standalone and combined Compose configurations validate successfully.

I did not start the containers because user-service startup connects to the live Neon database, creates missing tables, and may provision the initial admin account.

21-09-2026 12:33 | Usage scenario: Use ChatGPT to create UI for admin manager portal

Prompt:
In the UI sidebar menu add admin manger portal button right below profile please. It is supposed to navigate to admin-manager-portal page. Inside admin manager portal page, there should be two tabs, Admin and User. Clicking on admin will show all users with admin role and clicking on user will show all users with user role. Each entry should show username and email followed by a button beside it. For admin it should show revoke admin access button and in user tab, it should show grant admin access button. There should also be a search bar for you to search one or a few admins/user in admin and user tab respectively. I think our current endpoint to GET admin/user might need to change slightly

Key responses:
Implemented the admin manager portal.

Key changes:

- Added `/admin-manager-portal`.
- Sidebar link appears directly below Profile only for `admin_manager`.
- Added Admin and User tabs.
- Both tabs fetch their lists from the server.
- Search runs on Enter or Search button.
- Search supports case-insensitive partial username/email matching.
- Added grant/revoke buttons with confirmation and loading states.
- Session role is now stored globally and reused by the supplier page.

Updated API:

```http
GET /authentication/users?role=admin
GET /authentication/users?role=user
GET /authentication/users?role=admin&query=alex
```

Without `query`, it returns every account having the selected role. Existing calls without `role` still default to admins.

Main page: [AdminManagerPortal.tsx](/Users/weihungloh/FoC-Template/ui/src/pages/adminManagerPortal/AdminManagerPortal.tsx)

Verification completed:

- UI lint passed without warnings.
- UI production build passed.
- Backend OpenAPI schema generation passed.
- Confirmed `role` and `query` appear as endpoint parameters.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- No tests were added or run.

Live visual verification wasn’t performed because the local UI and user-service were not running. Changes remain uncommitted.

16-10-2026 11:55 | Usage Scenario: Order Service setup and database models

Prompt:

"in neondb i see the table, but i don't see anything about order model in the code? under src/auth/models.py theres only [...] if i design one, i should probably follow how we structured thefiles/ file name for user service since i worked on that previously, how would the code look?"

Key responses:

- Explained the distinction between SQLAlchemy ORM models and Pydantic request/response models.
- Provided example SQLAlchemy models based on the existing `errand_requests` schema.
- Suggested organizing database access and API files consistently with the existing User Service.
- Assisted with PostgreSQL enum definitions and database integration.

Key changes:

- Added the SQLAlchemy ORM model for errand_requests, including order identifiers, participant IDs, credits, status, and lifecycle timestamps.
- Configured PostgreSQL enum mapping for order statuses.
- Separated database models from Pydantic request and response schemas, following the existing service structure.
---

17-10-2026 16:19 | Usage scenario: Order Service review and implementation assistance

Prompt:
Review the changes on my current Git branch compared with origin/main. Focus on the Order Service implementation, including its FastAPI endpoints, SQLAlchemy ORM models, repository functions, authentication, and expiry worker. Identify correctness bugs, concurrency issues, security vulnerabilities, and inconsistencies with the existing User, Supplier, and Credit Services.

Follow-up prompt:
dont change the style from the other services so much. use sqlalchemy and psycopg db operations similar style to the other services

Key responses:
- Assisted with reviewing endpoint behaviour, authorization, order transitions, transactions, and expiry handling.
- Provided implementation assistance using asynchronous SQLAlchemy and psycopg.
- Explained potential concurrency issues and the importance of checking order state and acceptance deadlines inside database transactions.
- Discussed keeping the implementation consistent with the existing services.

Key changes:
- Used database row locking to serialize competing order-acceptance requests.
- Checked order state, courier eligibility, and the acceptance deadline after acquiring the lock.
- Kept database operations consistent with the existing asynchronous SQLAlchemy and psycopg implementation.

---

17-10-2026 22:16 | Usage scenario: Order-to-Credit messaging and result handling

Prompt:
please implement the required changes so that my credit reservation (to go from pending -> open), release and transfer is closer to credit service. refer to the implementation of credit service. do not use unnecessary complex stuff or other unnecessary things

Key responses:
- Assisted with implementing Order-side credit commands, the transactional command outbox, and Credit result consumption.
- Explained saving order changes and their associated commands in the same database transaction.
- Explained retaining stable request IDs so repeated messages do not repeat credit movements.
- Provided guidance on result-driven order transitions and recovery when publication or result delivery is delayed.

Key changes:

- Made reserve, release, and transfer command payloads compatible with Credit Service.
- Saved order changes and their associated credit commands in the same database transaction.
- Added a RabbitMQ command publisher and a consumer for CreditOperationResult messages.
- Stored result receipts to recognize duplicate results and correlate them with the original commands.
---

18-10-2026 02:11 | Usage scenario: Order Service startup refactoring

Prompt:
and can main.py for order service also be closer to how credit service is run?

Key responses:
- Compared Order and Credit Service initialization.
- Moved Order database initialization, messaging setup, expiry-worker startup, and cleanup into orders/bootstrap.py.
- Simplified main.py to use initialize_order_service().
- Explained why Order did not need RabbitMQ resources stored in app.state when workers already receive them directly.

Key changes:
- Introduced initialize_order_service() in orders/bootstrap.py to encapsulate database, messaging, and expiry-worker initialization.
- Simplified main.py to enter the initialization context during application lifespan.
- Preserved worker cancellation and resource cleanup on shutdown.

---

18-10-2026 02:15 | Usage scenario: Outbox publisher simplification and explanation

Prompt:
then, for the simplified outbox.py, how would the new code look like (so it matches more closely to credit) and still works?

Follow-up prompt:
yes, pls proceed with the porposed simplification and retain existing retry and result recovery logic. thank you

Key responses:
- Proposed and implemented moving command selection and locking into find_pending_credit_command() in the repository.
- Simplified transaction handling using session_factory.begin().
- Used the publish timeout argument consistently with Credit Service.
- Preserved retry delays, stable request IDs, publisher confirmations, and replay of commands without recorded results.
- Explained the difference between RabbitMQ publication confirmation and successful Credit processing.
Key changes:
- Moved pending-command selection into find_pending_credit_command() in the repository.
- Simplified publisher transaction handling using session_factory.begin().
- Aligned RabbitMQ publication with Credit Service's persistent messages, publisher confirmations, and publish-timeout argument.
- Preserved row locking, retry scheduling, and replay of commands whose results had not been recorded.

---

20-10-2026 21:59 | Usage Scenario: Centralized logging implementation support

Prompt:

"what is a good way i can implement centralized logging, I searched online and found Grafana"

Key responses:

- Explained structured logging and how logs can be collected from multiple Docker containers.
- Provided implementation guidance for Grafana Alloy, Loki, and Grafana.
- Explained log formatting, collection, and querying.
- Assisted with understanding correlation identifiers and debugging across HTTP and RabbitMQ operations.
- Discussed the distinction between application logs and database audit records.

Key changes:

- Added structured JSON logging with service names, timestamps, severity levels, and relevant operation identifiers.
- Included order and command identifiers in RabbitMQ processing and retry logs.
- Configured Grafana Alloy to collect Docker container logs and forward them to Loki.
- Added Grafana's Loki datasource configuration for querying collected logs.

---
27-10-2026 17:26 | Usage scenario: Use ChatGPT to create UI for credit audit log page

Prompt:
For credit audit logs 

Can add that button in menu right below Profile?

Credit audit logs shoild follow exisitng layout and be responsive. IT should fetch logs too. If no logs then jusjt say no logs. If no error e.g. credit not running just use same error msg as order page for credit wallet

Key responses:
Changed it to auto-update every 5 seconds, like the Orders wallet. “Refresh logs” is removed, and updates preserve your current page.

The page sits below Profile, fetches your logs, supports mobile layouts, shows “No logs.” when empty, and uses the wallet outage message with automatic recovery.

Build, lint and all 32 existing checks pass. Browser checks used simulated API responses. Nothing committed.

---
06-10-2026 21:38 | Usage scenario: Use ChatGPT to generate boiler template for credit service

Prompt:
In credit-service folder, can you follow the format in user-service e.g. main.py, db.py and views.py those. I want you to create the db engine using sql alchemy. Whatever that is in .env and .env example must be similar too. Do use rabbitMQ. You can get the references from supplier-service + .env files from it too

Key responses:
Credit Service is currently empty. I recommend User Service’s split structure over Supplier Service’s single-file layout:

- `src/main.py` for startup and shutdown.
- `src/common/config_manager.py` for `.env` settings.
- `src/common/db.py` for the async SQLAlchemy engine and sessions.
- `src/credit/views.py` for routes, starting with `/health`.
- RabbitMQ connection/channel setup following Supplier Service.
- Dependencies and Docker setup matching the sibling services.

The ignored `.env` will contain your supplied database URL using `postgresql+psycopg://`, matching User Service and [SQLAlchemy’s async driver format](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/dialects/postgresql.html#module-sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql.psycopg). `.env.example` will use placeholders and the same key-per-line format.

---
07-10-2026 16:52 | Usage scenario: Use ChatGPT to implement the user registration and credit allocation flow

Prompt:
Implement the signup-to-credit-account workflow using RabbitMQ, following the existing User Service and Supplier Service conventions. In both User Service and Credit Service, declare a durable DIRECT exchange named user_events during lifespan initialization and store the returned exchange in app.state.user_exchange, alongside the connection and channel, so it can be reused. After a user is successfully committed to the database, User Service should publish a persistent UserCreated event with routing key user.created, containing the actual stored user ID and creation timestamp. In Credit Service, declare a durable, non-exclusive queue named credit_user_created, bind it to that exchange with binding key user.created, and start consuming during startup. For each event, insert a credit account using the same user UUID, available_credits = 100, reserved_credits = 0, and the event’s creation timestamp for both initial created_at and updated_at, do not generate a separate timestamp. Make processing idempotent duplicate events must leave an existing account and its balance unchanged. Acknowledge the message only after the database operation commits successfully, and handle publication or processing failures so registration events are not silently lost. Follow the existing SQLAlchemy model and startup table-creation approach without adding a separate .sql file.

---
07-10-2026 17:53 | Usage scenario: Use ChatGPT to implement credit audit logs for backend

Prompt: 
Create the SQLAlchemy schema for a credit_audit_logs table in Credit Service, following the existing conventions in credit-service/src/credit/orm_models.py and reusing its declarative Base. Add a CreditAuditLog model with these fields: log_id as a UUID primary key generated with uuid4; user_id as a non-null UUID identifying the credit owner; recipient_user_id as a nullable UUID identifying the courier receiving a transfer; order_id as a nullable UUID; action as non-null text; amount as a non-null BigInteger; and created_at as a non-null DateTime(timezone=False) with no Python or database default, supplied by the application as the operation’s UTC timestamp without timezone information. Add named check constraints allowing only INITIAL_ALLOCATION, RESERVE, RELEASE, and TRANSFER; requiring amount > 0; requiring a recipient different from user_id for transfers and no recipient for other actions; and requiring no order ID for initial allocation but an order ID for all other actions. Do not add cross-database foreign keys, reason, operation_id, updated_at, compensation actions, or a separate .sql file. Ensure the model is included in the existing startup table-creation flow.

Dont include anything else please

Key responses:
Added `CreditAuditLog` in [orm_models.py](/Users/weihungloh/FoC-Template/credit-service/src/credit/orm_models.py) with exactly the requested fields and named constraints. The shared `Base` includes it in startup table creation automatically.

Verified PostgreSQL DDL and constraint behavior locally. Only this file changed; nothing committed.

---

04-11-2026 14:11 | Usage scenario: Investigate backend delivery-location, planned implementation

Prompt: I went through the current code and noticed delivery location is stored inside optional pickup_notes. The UI requires it, but the API allows an order without a destination. I’d like to make delivery location a separate required field so the backend enforces it too.

investgate this, and create a plan as to how we can refactor this to fix the gap.


Key responses:
Identified problem:
Delivery location is bundled into optional pickup_notes. The UI requires it, but the original API and database allow orders without a destination.
This means a caller can bypass UI validation and create an order that a courier cannot fulfil.

Created refactor plan:
- Add a separate required delivery_location, trimmed to 1–500 characters.
- Enforce it in the API and database.
- Include it in responses and idempotency checks.
- Update the UI to send and display it separately.
- Keep pickup notes optional.
- Migrate existing data or recreate the database under the repository’s deployment policy.

---

05-11-2026 15:17 | Usage scenario: Implement backend delivery-location refactor

Prompt:
Make delivery location a separate required backend field, trimmed to 1–500 characters. Update request/response schemas, ORM constraints, order creation and idempotency fingerprints. Keep pickup notes optional and add regression tests.

Key responses:
Implemented `delivery_location` across validation, persistence, responses and both idempotency lookup paths. Added a non-null text column and named length/nonblank constraint, schema/HTTP tests, and updated database-test fixtures. During implementation, all 28 order-service tests passed against disposable local PostgreSQL; changed-file Ruff checks passed. Changes remain local and uncommitted; UI integration and migration of the existing database are pending.

---

05-11-2026 15:34 | Usage scenario: Implement separate delivery location in the UI

Prompt:
Add delivery location to request/response types, send it separately from optional pickup notes, display both separately on order cards and admin case review, preserve retry payloads and idempotency keys, run UI tests/lint/build, and log the implementation.

Key responses:
Added required `delivery_location` types and a request builder that trims destination/items and sends blank notes as null. Updated order cards and admin review with separate labels. Regression checks cover request normalisation, optional-note rendering, and unchanged payload/key across lost-response retries. All 36 UI tests pass; lint passes with one existing audit-log warning; production builds pass, including Docker's Node 22 build. Refreshed the local UI container. Live authenticated checkout was not verified because backend Neon connections time out. Changes remain uncommitted.

---

05-11-2026 | Usage scenario: Plan saved errand templates N2H

Prompt:
Review the current errand workflow and propose a concise design for a repeat-errand N2H, including whether saved errands should reference historical orders or have their own table.

Key responses:
Recommended an Order-owned `saved_errands` template table rather than references to `errand_requests`: templates store reusable, editable fields (name, owner, supplier ID, items, delivery location, optional notes and offered credits), while orders remain immutable historical records. Selecting a template prefills a new editable request; submission creates a fresh order with a new idempotency key and still validates the current supplier and reserves credits through the existing workflow. Templates contain no order status, courier, deadline, reservation or settlement data, and ownership must be enforced server-side.

---

09-11-2026 | Usage scenario: Add failing saved-errand API contract tests

Prompt:
Can you write the test? Define the saved-errand contract in tests before implementation: users can create, list, update and delete only their own templates; templates contain reusable request fields; selecting one only prefills a new order.

Key responses:
Added five API contract tests for `/orders/saved-errands`. The red test run confirms they fail because saved-errand routes are not implemented yet; expected creation/list/selection responses currently return 405, 422 or 404. The ownership tests first require successful creation, preventing absent routes from falsely satisfying access-control expectations.

---

09-11-2026 | Usage scenario: Implement saved-errand backend

Prompt:
Add a `SavedErrand` ORM model to Order Service, create schemas for create/update/response/draft, add owner-scoped repository functions and `/orders/saved-errands` CRUD routes, then run the five tests until they pass.

Key responses:
Implemented the saved-errand template backend in Order Service: an owner-indexed `saved_errands` model; create, partial-update, response and draft schemas; owner-scoped repository operations; and CRUD routes at `/orders/saved-errands`. Selecting a template returns only editable new-order fields, never lifecycle, reservation or deadline data. The five contract tests and changed-file Ruff checks pass; no UI or deployment changes were made.

---

10-11-2026 | Usage scenario: Complete saved-errand UI and PATCH validation

Prompt:
Implement explicit-null rejection for required saved-errand PATCH fields while allowing omissions and clearing pickup notes. Add Save as template with a name, a personal template list with use/edit/rename/delete, editable prefilling, fresh order idempotency keys with stable retries, separate template/order feedback, and log AI usage.

Key responses:
Codex added a PATCH field validator and HTTP regression tests: explicitly supplied null is rejected for name, supplier, items, destination and credits; omitted fields remain unchanged and pickup_notes can be cleared. Added typed saved-errand API bindings and an Orders-page template list with refresh/error states, editable prefilling, template saving, edit/rename and confirmed deletion. Template saving is a separate action from order submission and reports its outcome independently; it does not reserve credits. Existing order creation still handles current supplier validation, credit reservation and idempotent retries. Template selection and saving cannot replace an uncertain order attempt. Review also identified and fixed stale list responses restoring deleted cards and New request reopening the previous template's edit mode.

---


10-11-2026 | Usage scenario: Resolve saved-template branch conflicts with latest main

Prompt:
Merge the changed main version into the saved-errand feature branch, make sure it is current, resolve conflicts, and leave the commit to the user.

Key responses:
Fetched Team P11 origin/main at f025c35 and merged it locally without committing. Combined incoming team contributions with Kenneth's README entry. Retained saved-template order creation and moved main's uuidv4 generation into newCreationAttempt so retries keep their existing payload/key and new requests work without crypto.randomUUID. Added a regression test for that environment and updated isolated test module resolution for uuid. Preserved the user's pre-existing .gitignore edits outside the staged merge.

Verification:
40 UI tests passed; 23 Order Service tests passed with 14 database tests skipped. Node 22 production build passed and UI lint passed with the existing audit-log warning. An incoming deployment test fails on macOS because deploy/aws-env.sh uses chmod 700 --; this file was preserved from main. Changes are staged for the user's merge commit; nothing was committed or pushed by Codex.

05-11-2026 | Usage scenario: Discuss AWS deployment and draft Terraform setup

Prompt (approximate reconstruction, not a verbatim quote):
Help me work out how to deploy this project on AWS for a short coursework demo using Terraform. Discuss the options and trade-offs with me, including how the services, RabbitMQ, Neon databases, networking and secrets should fit together. Turn the agreed approach into a deployment design, implementation plan and initial Terraform configuration. Do not provision AWS resources yet.

Key responses (summary, not a verbatim quote):
Helped the user reason through the deployment rather than only generating configuration: discussed separate ECS Fargate services, ALB access for the UI and backend Swagger pages, private managed RabbitMQ, and externally supplied Neon databases. Made demo-scope trade-offs explicit, including public-subnet tasks without a NAT gateway, a single-instance broker, restricted inbound access, HTTP limitations and ongoing AWS costs. Clarified safe credential/state handling and a staged setup so images and secrets are ready before services start.

Recorded the agreed decisions in an AWS deployment design and task-by-task plan, then assisted with the initial Terraform setup under `deploy/terraform/` and deployment instructions in `deploy/AWS.md`. The recorded handoff reported local Terraform validation and mock-provider tests; it did not claim a live AWS deployment. The design and plan originally lived under `docs/superpowers/`; this entry preserves a summary of that assistance after those planning documents were removed.

Date not recorded | Usage scenario: Set up the Nginx internal gateway

Prompt (approximate reconstruction, not a verbatim quote):
Help me set up Nginx as an internal gateway for the User, Supplier, Order and Credit services in Docker Compose. Route the frontend API calls through it, explain the service URLs and configuration I need, and keep authentication in the backend services.

Key responses (summary, not a verbatim quote):
Assisted with the Nginx gateway and UI proxy configuration so requests follow Browser → UI Nginx → internal gateway → backend service. Configured service-specific API prefixes, stripping only the prefix while forwarding request details, authentication headers, cookies and backend status codes. Explained the distinction between browser-facing URLs and Docker-internal service addresses, and how environment-supplied upstream URLs and DNS resolution support the setup. The gateway remains internal to Compose rather than publishing an additional host port; setup and troubleshooting instructions are documented in `internal-gateway/README.md`.
